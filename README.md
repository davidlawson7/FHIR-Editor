# FhirEditorV2
This is the most recent version of the FHIR editor.

## Installing
 1. First run `npm install` to install base app and packages.
 2. Then run `npm i ng2-select --save` and `npm install bootstrap@3` to install both ng2-select and bootstrap 3.
 3. Server by running `ng serve`. This will serve the app at http://localhost:4200. If you need to run on a different port, run `ng serve --port PORT-NUMBER`. Replace PORT-NUMBER with the desired port number.
